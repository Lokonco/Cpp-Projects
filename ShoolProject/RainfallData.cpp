/*Psuedocode
 * Variables
 *
 * User input for total Rainfall for each of the 12 months # Done

 * If statements incase input is negative  #Done

 * Store Input into array of doubles #Done

 * Calculate Total, Mean for months and months with lowest and highest Rainfall

 * Output calculations and list of months in lowest to highest #Done

 */

/* Algorithm
 * total = Iterate thru every element in array and add each element together.
 * mean = Use total function to get total of all elements then divide them by the amount of months.
 * lowest/highest = Iterate thru elements in array and update largest/smallest variable each time a smaller or bigger
 * element is found.
 * Sorting = use sort built in function  to sort array in ascending order.
 */

/* Desk check
 * total = each input is 1, 1 added to 1, 12 times is 12
 *
 *mean = array = {2,13,13,14,16,28,13,43,42,12,13,2}
 * array elements added = 211, 211 / 12 = 17.58
